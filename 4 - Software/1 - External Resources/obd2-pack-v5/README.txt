Thanks for downloading our OBD2 data pack!

This pack contains the following:
1) Our OBD2 Intro & Data Logger articles in PDF form
2) Our OBD2 DBC file (for both 11-bit CAN IDs and 29-bit CAN IDs)
3) Various OBD2 sample log files - incl. an extensive one from a SEAT Leon
4) A collection of reverse-engineered DBC files, primarily from the opendbc github repo


You can open the MF4 log files e.g. in below software tools and use the OBD2 DBC to decode the data:

1) asammdf GUI: Good starting point for opening, DBC decoding and plotting the data
